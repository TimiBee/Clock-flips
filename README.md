## Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/TimiBee/Clock-flips.git](https://github.com/TimiBee/Clock-flips.git)
    cd Clock-flips
    ```
2.  **Open `index.html`:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to view the clock.



## Customization Guide

The project is designed to be easily customizable. Here's how:

* **HTML Structure:** The `index.html` file is well-organized with clear comments, allowing you to easily modify the structure of the clock.
* **CSS Styling:** The `assets/scss/` directory contains the SCSS files, which are highly recommended for making styling changes. SCSS offers features like variables, nesting, and mixins, making it easier to manage and maintain styles. The compiled CSS files are in `assets/css/`.
* **JavaScript Functionality:** The `assets/js/` directory contains the JavaScript files. The code is commented to explain the functionality of different functions and selections, enabling you to modify the clock's behavior.
* **Icons:** The project uses Ion Icons and Icons8. You can replace these with Font Awesome, Material Icons, or any other icon library you prefer. Remember to update the HTML accordingly if you change icon libraries.
